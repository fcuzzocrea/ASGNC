The first step in the control design process is to develop appropriate mathematical models of the system through physical laws or experimental data. In this section, we introduce the state-space and transfer function representations of dynamic systems.
Once appropriate mathematical models of a system have been obtained, either in state-space or transfer function form, we may then analyze these models to predict how the system will respond in both time and frequency domains. To put this in context, control systems are often designed to improve stability, speed of response, steady-state error, or prevent oscillations. In this section, we will show how to determine these dynamic properties from the system models.
