A navigation system is necessary for any kind of vehicle that has to move in a open environment and become more and more necessary the less constraints it has in its dynamics. Take a train for example, it has just one degree of freedom (if we do not include interchanges between rails) therefore it just need to know where it is along the rail, but the position of the rails are known beforehand. On the other hand a plane has six degrees of freedom and it has no physically fixed roads and it needs more instruments to understand its location. 

Moreover we must be aware that a physical system is a time continuous process while measurement, since we make use of digital computers and similar devices, are taken as discrete samples of such continuous signals. 

One thing that must be clear before using the information from the sensors: no measure is perfect. Measurements are affected by various kind of noises and errors, therefore having knowledge of random processes is quite a must.
